Does the great firewall protect netizen or destroy people’s privacy? 
In this project, I visualized the usage of great internet firewall of China. 
I decided to adapt a sarcastic but also humorous tone in my visual language to explain how the great firewall is working in the internet world.
I am also aware of how the censorship promotes people’s self-censorship. Therefore, this inspires me to create a website of selling mask of
“correct speaking”. The mask intend to help people to correct their speaking style both offline and online; thus become a better “netizen” and “citizen” in 
Virtual and real world.

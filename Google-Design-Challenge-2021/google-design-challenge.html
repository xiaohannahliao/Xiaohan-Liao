              <br /><br />If there is more time, iteration on conducting more usability tests can help generate more
              insights about the efficiency of the new modules. For example, what are the design friction I might
              encounter when deploying virtual tour on mobile? If I am collaborating with engineers, how would I address
              these issues to make these functions really happen smoothly?
